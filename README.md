# CHECKER – SOC Attack Simulation Tool

An automated Bash-based framework designed to simulate real-world attacks for SOC training, detection testing, and incident readiness.

---

## Overview

CHECKER automates the full workflow of internal attack simulations:
- Network interface discovery  
- Live host enumeration (Nmap)  
- Attack selection (DoS, MITM, Brute-Force, or Random)  
- Target selection (manual or random)  
- Timed execution of real offensive tools  
- Detailed logging for auditing & SOC training

This tool allows SOC teams to practice identifying and responding to real attack behaviors in a safe, controlled lab environment.

## Supported Attack Types

### DoS Attack (hping3)
Sends high-volume SYN packets to the target to simulate service exhaustion.

### MITM Attack (arpspoof)
Executes ARP poisoning, enables IP forwarding, and intercepts network traffic.

### Brute-Force Attack (Hydra)
Attempts SSH authentication using a password wordlist to simulate credential-guessing attempts.

### Random Attack Mode
Selects one of the above attacks randomly for unpredictable SOC exercises.

## Key Features

- Automatic interface & IP detection  
- Live host scanning using Nmap  
- Attack automation with real tools  
- Safe IP-exclusion (prevents self-attack)  
- Clean terminal UI with colored output  
- Full audit logs saved to `/var/log/attack log files.txt`  
- Loop mode for multiple attack runs
